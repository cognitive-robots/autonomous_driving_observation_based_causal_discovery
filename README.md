# Evaluating Temporal Observation-Based Causal Discovery Techniques Applied to Road Driver Behaviour

The data and scripts here relate to experiments carried out as part of a body of research work determining how readily existing causal discovery techniques based upon observation can be applied to the domain of autonomous driving.

## Scripts
Contains scripts either used directly to carry out the causal discovery, or indirectly to generate, manipulate, or evaluate data. Further descriptions will be provided within the relevant directories.

## Data
The data resulting from the experiments carried out. Non-synthetic datasets used in experiments are the Lyft Level 5 Prediction Dataset (https://self-driving.lyft.com/level5/prediction/) and the High-D Dataset (https://www.highd-dataset.com/). Both datasets are free, but may require an application to accesss.
