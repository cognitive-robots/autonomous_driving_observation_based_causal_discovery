# Semi-Synthetic Experiments
* Lyft Semi-Synthetic: Contains experiments carried out on the Lyft semi-synthetic dataset. This dataset was created by joining consecutive scenes together to produce scenes of much greater length. The synthetic aspect is due to the fact it would be impossible to find a an independent agent that spans all of the merged scenes. To remedy this the path taken by another ego vehicle is used to provide data for the role of independent agent. This ensures the data is truly independent, however this comes at the cost of the realism of the data, as it involves merging data from two sources that in no way intereacted with one another in the real world.
