# Types of Experiments
* Real World Experiments: Experiments carried out on data captured from the real world, not necessarily carried out on a live system.
* Synthetic Experiments: Experiments carried out on data generated on a computer.
* Semi-synthetic Experiments: Experiments carried out on data captured from the real world, but manipulated in such a way that the data can no longer be considered totally true to the real world.
