# Code

## Causal Discovery for Time Series
The primary codebase used for the benchmark evaluation carried out in the paper. The codebase has been sanitised in order to decouple it from this specific paper. Hence all input and output data relevant to the paper is contained in this repository.

## Utilities
Contains helper scripts used both for important tasks such as extracting and generating causal scene data and simple tasks such as calculating statistical information.
